# Identity User Testing

## Introduction

What devices do you have available? Ideally Phone with facial recognition/fingerprint sensor and a Laptop with a Yubikey

Thank you a lot for participating.
First impressions are precious, everyone only gets theirs of the Internet Identity service once, and we're very grateful you're sharing it with us.

I'll ask you to accomplish a couple of tasks for me today.
You cannot fail today, in particular I'm not testing your ability to use our UI.
I'm testing how and if our UI manages to assist you in accomplishing these tasks and where it falls short.

I'll ask you to try and use our UI as you usually would with one key difference.
Please externalize your thought process as much as possible.
If you're reading parts of the UI, read them out loud, try to tell me what you're thinking about and what you're doing at every step.

Once we reach the part where you use your laptop I'd also like you to share your screen.
(Or we can start sharing right now, so we can stay in the flow)

If it's alright with you I'd also like to record our session, as I'd rather focus on following what you're doing over frantically taking notes.

I'll share two Url's with you. One for Open Chat, and one for the identity service:

- https://identity.messaging.dfinity.network
- https://3cwd2-fiaaa-aaaaa-qaava-cai.messaging.dfinity.network

## The tasks:
- 1. Login to Open Chat on your Phone
  - a) Go to the Open Chat URL and sign up
  - b) Register with Internet Identity naming your device "Phone"
  - c) Pick an Account name for Open Chat
- 2. Logout and back into Open Chat
  - a) Go to the Open Chat URL and log yourself out (help them here,
    we're not testing the usability of the Open Chat UI)
  - b) Login with Open Chat again
  - c) Verify your Open Chat account name is the same
- 3. Login to Open Chat on your Laptop
  - a) Try to login to Open Chat with your existing account (Stop
    people if they try to register again, if they don't realize they
    need to add a new device help them)
  - b) Add your YubiKey as a new device to your Internet Identity naming it "YubiKey"
  - c) Login to Open Chat with your YubiKey
  - d) Verify your Open Chat acount name is the same
- 4. Disabling your YubiKey as a means of logging in
  - a) Go to the Internet Identity service on your Phone
  - b) Remove your YubiKey device from your Internet Identity
  - c) Verify you can no longer login to Open Chat

## Follow-up questions
  - Would you enjoy signing up/logging in with services like this in the future?
  - Which part felt the least intuitive?
  - What's your user number?
